NAME
    Test::BSON - Test BSON documents

VERSION
    This document describes Test::BSON version 0.01.

SYNOPSIS
       use Test::BSON;

       bson_ok $bson,                 'bson is well formed';
       bson_is $bson, $expected_bson, 'bson matches what we expected';

DESCRIPTION
    BSON is a binary-encoded extension of JSON. Test::BSON makes it easy to
    verify that you have built a valid BSON document and that it matches
    what you expected.

EXPORTED TESTS
  bson_ok
    Test passes if the string passed is a valid BSON document.

       bson_ok $bson, 'bson is well formed';

    "is_valid_bson" is provided as an alternative to "bson_ok" using the
    same naming convention as Test::JSON but is not exported by default.

  bson_is
    Test passes if the two BSON documents are valid and evaluate to the same
    data structure.

       bson_is $bson, $expected_bson, 'bson matches what we expected';

    Test::Differences is used to provide easy diagnostics of why the BSON
    documents did not match. For example:

          Failed test 'bson matches what we expected'
          in t/bson.t at line 10.

    "is_bson" is provided as an alternative to "bson_is" using the same
    naming convention as Test::JSON but is not exported by default.
